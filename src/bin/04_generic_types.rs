// Seen in this chapter:
// - Generic types in structs, enums
// - Option :D
// - Result :D!
// - Error handling?!
// - Unwrapping
// - Vectors

// That's a lot!

// Exercise: create a generic struct that holds a type,
// and an enum that contains several different generic types.
// And... That's it. We're still lacking important stuff to write
// interesting code with generic types.

// Exercise: create a function that takes a filename (`String`), removes a
// suffix (`- Copy`), and returns the filename if the suffix was found, else
// an error. Yes, we'll return a `Result` :D

// Exercise: use the previous function, and print the result after being unwrapped!

// Exercise: use the previous function, print the result after using the `?` operator
// from the `main` function. It means that we'll need to update the `main` function's prototype!

// Exercise: use the previous function, and print an error message if the function fails.

fn main() {}
